In the CSE440 Project for Fall 2023, I embarked on a comprehensive exploration of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically focusing on sentiment analysis of IMDB movie reviews. 

**Tasks Undertaken:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Utilized Pandas to load and preprocess the IMDB review dataset.
2. **Word Embedding:** Employed pre-trained GloVe vectors to convert textual reviews into numerical vectors, leveraging semantic information embedded in the word representations.
3. **Model Construction:** Designed and trained a shallow recurrent neural network (RNN) with an initial dense layer, progressing to incorporate LSTM layers for enhanced sequential modeling.
4. **Model Comparison:** Evaluated the performance of different architectures, including unidirectional and bidirectional LSTMs, to discern optimal model configurations for sentiment classification.

**Skills Acquired:**
1. **Data Handling:** Gained proficiency in data manipulation and preprocessing techniques using Pandas, ensuring data readiness for model training.
2. **Embedding Techniques:** Developed expertise in utilizing pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe to capture semantic relationships and contextual information in text data.
3. **Neural Network Architectures:** Acquired hands-on experience in constructing and optimizing sequential neural network models, transitioning from basic dense layers to advanced LSTM structures.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Explored the impact of varying hyperparameters, such as batch size and epoch count, on model performance, fostering a deeper understanding of neural network dynamics.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Enhanced skills in rigorously evaluating and comparing different model architectures based on performance metrics, facilitating data-driven decision-making in model selection.

This project not only enriched my technical proficiency in NLP and deep learning but also honed my analytical and evaluative skills, enabling me to critically assess model performance and identify avenues for future enhancements in sentiment analysis tasks.
